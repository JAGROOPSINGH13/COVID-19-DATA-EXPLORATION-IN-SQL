# COVID-19-DATA-EXPLORATION PROJECT

This project explores COVID-19 data from January 2020 to November 2022. Basic to advanced SQL queries are executed to answer questions and look at trends over the course of COVID-19. After the data exploration is complete in SQL, the queries are used to create some data visualizations in Tableau. My data exploration in SQL can be viewed here and my dashboard in Tableau here. This project was built using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

# TASK
The goal of this project is to explore 2020-2022 COVID-19 Data by performing queries in SQL. I choose to look at insights for the INDIA since I am a INDIAN citizen. I also explored data globally and regionally.

# Key Findings
* As of 11/23/2022, there have been 98,503,462 COVID-19 cases in the US. The current US death percentage is about 1.095%, meaning there is about a 1.1% chance of dying if you contract COVID-19.
* While the number of cases has increased in total, the death percentage has declined. One year ago, there was a ~1.6% chance of dying upon contraction in the INDIA. Two years ago, ~2% chance of dying upon contraction.
* The highest infection rate is among European countries. The country with the highest infection rate is Cyprus. Of course this is relative to their population.
* The US has an infection rate of ~29%. In 2020, the US infection rate was ~3.7%. In 2021 it was ~14.2%. The infection rate now it almost 8 times as much as it was in 2020 and twice as much as it was in 2021.
* Presently, there are 637,876,021 cases and 6,588,157 deaths worldwide due to COVID-19. The current global death percentage is 1.03282719260582%. 
* As of right now, North America has the highest death count due to COVID-19
