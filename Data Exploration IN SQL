COVID-19 Data Exploration

Skills Used:  WINDOWS FUNCTIONS, AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS, CONVERTING DATA TYPES
Data: The dataset is from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths. It has data from January 2020 to November 2022. 
I manipulated the data in Excel to contain the columns I wanted to work with.
Task: The goal of this project is to explore 2020-2022 COVID-19 Data by asking and answering data exploration questions. 
I choose to look at insights for the INDIA since I am a INDIA citizen. I also explored data globally and regionally.

---as of november 2022 there are 44671708 total cases and the death percentage is about 1.18%
---this means that 44671708 people have been infected by COVID-19 since JAN 2020 and that there is about a 1.18% chance of dying if you contract COVID-19 while living in INDIA.
